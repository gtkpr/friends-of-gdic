# Friends of Girl Develop It Columbus
A simple project to practice using Git and creating pull requests! We're
compiling a list of the names of the wonderful people who make up this
organization. Are you one of us? Please add your own name to the list!

[View the list here!](https://csteinert.github.io/friends-of-gdic/)

## How to Contribute
Check out the [issues](https://github.com/csteinert/friends-of-gdic/issues)
for ideas of things to do with this repository! Adding your name to the list is
just one of the options here! If you think there are other improvements that
can be made to the project that aren't listed in the issues... *add a new issue*!

This README is, itself, incomplete! I'd love some help adding resources for
those folks who are new to Git/GitHub. Please feel free to contribute to this
portion of the project as well!

## How to Submit a Pull Request
1. Navigate to the project's main page (i.e. https://github.com/csteinert/friends-of-gdic).
2. Click on any item in the list of files to open that file in the browser's text editor.
3. Make edits.
4. Click the green, 'Propose file change' button which is under the text editor near the bottom of the page.
5. Click the green, 'Create pull request' button which is near the middle of the following page.
6. Pat yourself on the back for figuring out this overly complex process.

Some of GitHub's official documentation regarding pull requests, which itself needs a lot of work, can be found here:
- [About Pull Requests] (https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
- [Creating a Pull Request] (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
